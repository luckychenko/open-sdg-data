  ## Definition:
  The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living 
  below the national poverty line.The rural poverty rate is the percentage of 
  the rural population living below the national poverty line (or incases where 
  a separate, rural poverty line is used, the rural poverty line). Urban poverty 
  rate is thepercentage of the urban population living below the national poverty 
  line (or in cases where a separate,urban poverty line is used, the urban poverty line).
  
  ## Concepts:
  In assessing poverty in a given country, and how best to reduce poverty according 
  to national definitions,one naturally focuses on a poverty line that is considered 
  appropriate for that country. Poverty lines acrosscountries vary in terms of their 
  purchasing power, and they have a strong economic gradient, such that
  richer countries tend to adopt higher standards of living in defining poverty. 
  Within a country, the cost ofliving is typically higher in urban areas than in rural 
  areas. Some countries may have separate urban andrural poverty lines to represent different purchasing powers
