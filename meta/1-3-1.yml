  ## Definition:
  The indicator reflects the proportion of persons effectively covered 
  by a social protection system,including social protection floors. It also reflects 
  the main components of social protection: child andmaternity benefits, support for 
  persons without a job, persons with disabilities, victims of work injuriesand older 
  persons.Effective coverage of social protection is measured by the number of people 
  who are either actively contributing to a social insurance scheme or receiving benefits
   (contributory or non-contributory).

   ## Concepts:
   Social protection systems include contributory and non-contributory schemes for children, 
   pregnantwomen with newborns, people in active age, older persons, for victims of work injuries 
   and persons withdisabilities. Social protection floors provide at least a basic level in all main 
   contingencies along the lifecycle, as defined in the Social Protection Floors Recommendation 2012 
   (no. 202) referred to in SDG 1.3.When assessing coverage and gaps in coverage, distinctions need to 
   be made between coverage by (1)contributory social insurance, (2) universal schemes covering all residents 
   (or all residents in a givencategory), and (3) means-tested schemes potentially covering all those who pass
   the required test ofincome and/or assets.
